# fuzzywuzzy
Couple of tryouts of the fuzzywuzzy library


fuzzy_wuzzy_test_1 
Created to see what the output is of the library.

fuzzy_wuzzy_test_2 
Short test to see how this could be applied at work. They have a lot of variation of names in their system due to manual supplier namme additions of the operators. This test was written to see if we can get a numerical comparison so that above a certain simularity we can trigger a reviesw of the entries and prevent the creating of double values in the system.
